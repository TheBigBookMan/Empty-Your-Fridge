# Empty Your Fridge

## Introduction

As someone who has been a student for many years of my life, I always found that I had many random ingredients left laying around in the fridge. I would have no idea what to do with them and it was hard to find ways to figure out what to make. Most recipe apps have the user search up the food they want and then can view the ingredients they need to buy to create it, however they don't work the reversed way. So i decided to create an app where the user can input the ingredients they have and select certain criteria to match what type of meal they want to make, and the application will show a range of recipes that contain those ingredients.

## Technologies

This app was built with Javascript, a third party API, TailwindCSS and create-react-app.

## Functionality

This application allows the user to select basic criteria for a specific type of food they are interested in making. The user can also select any ingredients that they wish to include (preferable ingredients they are keen to get rid of!) and then submitting the request. The EDAMAM food API will be called with the query selections and then a response with a list of items will be presented, with icons and titles. The user can then click on the url link and be taken to the website page that hosts the recipe for that item. The user can also select the favourite icon which will then store that item into the favourites section on the side. The user can access the url link to the hosted recipe website or also remove that item from the favourites list.
