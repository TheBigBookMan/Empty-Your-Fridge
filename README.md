# Empty Your Fridge

## Introduction

As someone who has been a student for many years of my life, I always found that I had many random ingredients left laying around in the fridge. I would have no idea what to do with them and it was hard to find ways to figure out what to make. Most recipe apps have the user search up the food they want and then can view the ingredients they need to buy to create it, however they don't work the reversed way. So i decided to create an app where the user can input the ingredients they have and select certain criteria to match what type of meal they want to make, and the application will show a range of recipes that contain those ingredients.

## Technologies

This app was built with Javascript, a third party API, TailwindCSS and create-react-app.
